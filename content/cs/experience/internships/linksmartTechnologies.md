## Summer Tech Intern 
> June 2023 - August 2023

### Summary
During the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to work as an on-site tech intern at __Linksmart Technologies__, a small IP-driven startup. In this role, I collaborated closely with a dedicated team, engaging in a variety of tasks ranging from marketing material and demo preparation to developing customer-facing pages and contributing to the company's core backend architecture. This experience provided me with a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of software development, from networking and data processing to API integration.

Working alongside another intern, I honed my teamwork skills, learning to collaborate effectively on projects that were critical to the company's operations. We were responsible for delivering end-to-end functionalities that met the company's design specifications, all within tight deadlines. This process not only sharpened my technical abilities but also taught me the importance of precision and adherence to requirements in a professional setting.

Additionally, participating in daily standups allowed me to understand the dynamics of working within a hierarchical structure. Despite the structured environment, I was encouraged to maintain creativity in how I approached the implementation of various projects. This balance between following established protocols and innovating within those boundaries was a key takeaway from my time at Linksmart Technologies.
