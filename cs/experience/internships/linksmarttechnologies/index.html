In this role, I collaborated closely with a dedicated team, engaging in a variety of tasks ranging from marketing material and demo preparation to developing customer-facing pages and contributing to the company’s core backend architecture. This experience provided me with a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of software development, from networking and data processing to API integration.\nWorking alongside another intern, I honed my teamwork skills, learning to collaborate effectively on projects that were critical to the company’s operations. We were responsible for delivering end-to-end functionalities that met the company’s design specifications, all within tight deadlines. This process not only sharpened my technical abilities but also taught me the importance of precision and adherence to requirements in a professional setting.\nAdditionally, participating in daily standups allowed me to understand the dynamics of working within a hierarchical structure. Despite the structured environment, I was encouraged to maintain creativity in how I approached the implementation of various projects. This balance between following established protocols and innovating within those boundaries was a key takeaway from my time at Linksmart Technologies.\nProjects Showcase Event\nDeveloped a registration portal for gathering data and providing analytics from company marketing events. The project required quick turnaround to ensure readiness for upcoming events.\nEdited and refined a promotional video and presentation to align with the company’s vision. This was accomplished under tight deadlines, ensuring all materials were prepared in time for a critical event.\nDevelopment Tools Used Company website modifications\nI implemented subtle enhancements to the company website after prototyping React based frontends, finally implementing the design which met the company’s expectations meeting the company’s design expectations.\nDevelopment Tools Used Django Admin Portal Modifications\nIntegrated Google Maps and OpenStreetMap into Django’s admin portal, enhancing the geographic data visualization capabilities. Developed a comprehensive analytics view within Django’s admin portal, enabling customer companies’ admins to access and interpret crucial data insights. Development Tools Used Designed and Implemented Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Solution\nI developed a robust 2FA system to enhance the security of user accounts. This system integrated SMS and Email verification using a combination of AWS services, including DynamoDB for storing user data, SNS for sending messages, API Gateway for handling requests, and Lambda functions for processing authentication logic. The entire process was seamlessly integrated into the existing Django application, ensuring a secure and efficient user experience.\nDevelopment Tools Used Optimized Image Transfer with WebRTC and ASGI Integration\nTransitioned from HTTP to WebRTC socket connections to significantly enhance image transfer speed between client and server during label scanning. Leveraged ASGI with Django to support real-time WebRTC communications on the server side. Additionally, configured Nginx to seamlessly interface with an existing Apache server, ensuring compatibility and streamlined operations. This project was completed within a stringent deadline, demonstrating the ability to rapidly adapt and deliver effective solutions under pressure. Development Tools Used CNN for image classification using PyTorch\nDeveloped and refined multiple iterations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for multi-class image classification. Utilized PyTorch and TorchVision frameworks, incorporating the RESNET architecture to build robust and accurate models. Implemented and tested various configurations to optimize performance and achieve the desired classification results. Successfully completed the entire process, from model design to training and evaluation, within a 2-week timeframe, demonstrating proficiency in deep learning and effective project management under tight deadlines.
